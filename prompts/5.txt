LEGAL MOVES: !legal_moves!, NULL

Transform the comma-delimited list of chess moves above to csv format. Follow the rules below:
- If move has "#", checkmate, 10 points
- If move has "=", promotion, 6 points
- If move has "x", capture, 4 points
- If first letter is lowercase, pawn, 2 points
- If move has "+", check, 0 points
- If none of the above, none, 0 points
- Use 1 or 0 for boolean value
- Stop after 30 moves
- If hit NULL value, ignore it and stop

After you are done, focus on the csv data and output the following report:
```
---
I have examined each row in the csv table and I have observed the greatest value in the total_points column (the one on the far right) is: {greatest value}, {explanation}
The entry with the largest total_points is: {entry with greatest total points}, {explanation}
Therefore, I submit my SELECTED_MOVE: {move}, {explanation}
```
