!legal_moves!

Transform the list of chess moves above to csv format. Following these rules:
- If the move contains "#", it's a checkmate, worth 10 points
- If the move contains "=", it's a promotion, worth 6 points
- If the move contains "x", it's a capture, worth 4 points
- If the first letter is lowercase, it's a pawn move, worth 2 points
- If the move contains "+", it's a check, worth 1 point
- All other moves are worth 0 points
- Use 1 and 0 for boolean values

After you are done, select the move with the greatest total_points and output:
```
Greatest total_points: {greatest_total_points}
SELECTED_MOVE: {move}, {explanation}
```
